Twilio REST bindings packaged for PHP 5.3
-----------------------------------------


This *IS NOT* original work. I've just repackaged the original Twilio PHP
API (only REST bindings) located here: [https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php) and
added a very simple test.

This is meant to be a simple replacement for Twilio PHP API library for us that don't
use TwiML and only want basic functionality (in my case, just to send
SMS).
